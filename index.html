              Role models are people who influence others by serving as
              examples. They are often admired by the people who emulate them.
              Through their perceived personal qualities, behaviours and
              achievements they can inspire others to strive and develop without
              providing any direct instruction. Being a positive role model
              actually requires effort, fore-thought and self-control. Because
              people are watching you all the time, your actions, beliefs and
              attitudes become integrated into other people’s lives. People tend
              to unconsciously imitate and take on the traits of others over a
              period of time, therefore, always be mindful of how you act and
              behave. Being aware of this huge responsibility can encourage you
              to better yourself.

              Everyone has the capacity to become a role model. You may already
              play that role for someone and not even know it. You don’t have to
              be famous, brilliant or a genius to be a role model for others.
              Simple thing like being a good listener is good enough at times.
              Help others to recognize their strengths, show kindness and be an
              encouraging person. When you see something beautiful in someone,
              tell them. It may take a second to say but for them it may last a
              lifetime.
